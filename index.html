                <h2>Teach For Liberia’s mission is to build the movement to expand
                    educational opportunity by enlisting Liberia’s most promising future leaders.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Teach For Liberia</strong>  addresses the educational crisis in Liberia by recruiting passionate college graduates/professionals,  who we provide with tailored, high-quality training for placement in rural and urban primary schools for two years. TFL alumni go on to become school, district, and community leaders, advocates, and entrepreneurs who work together with other stakeholders to change a system that leaves so many Liberian children behind. TFL is working to reach 125,000 Liberian 
                        children by 2025- greatly improving their life prospects through placing 700 high quality 
                        teachers in  90 local schools and communities.</p>

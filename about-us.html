                <p>
                   Charles Dean Wilson a professional in the Public Health Sector realizes a need to help communities
                   that were improverished while deployed to Liberia in 2014 to help with the Ebola Crisis.

                   where he acquired his Bachelor’s degree in Public Health with honors in 2015.
                   After graduation Charles organized a community program in Southwest Philadelphia. The 
                   Program taught kids the importance of interpersonal skills and volunteering. After finding success
                   within the program in 2017 Quality Public Initiatives was launched to further expand on the 
                   efforts of the previous program. In an effort to advance his knowledge base on such issues the 
                   CEO matriculated into the University of Texas where he obtained a Masters in Public Administration
